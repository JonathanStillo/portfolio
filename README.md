### Work Experience
Backup Systems Operator @Walmart Fullfillment Center

#### Context: 
I was trained and hired primarily to be a warehouse associate, but was quickly recognized as fast learning/adaptive to the point where I handled multiple different positions. As the company's internal network was frequently experiencing performance slowdowns (especially during peak hours), I was assigned to the System Operator team as a backup associate.

#### My Tasks/Role in the company: 

- Provide support to internal and external customers by researching data on system and network related issues. 
- Maintain operation of system hardware through monitoring functionality, preventative maintenance, identifying and reporting or resolving performance issues. 
- Install, monitor, maintain and repair system hardware, software, and peripheral equipment, following design or installation specifications. 
- Respond to and resolve critical systems issues (e.g., system or hardware down); respond and follow up on urgent customer requests. 
- Respond to internal and external customer calls related to orders, claims, damages, billing issues, etc. by researching and resolving system-related issues. 
- Perform daily administrative tasks including pass down reports, billing, user access coding, and filing. 
- Coordinate and support security measures to safeguard information against accidental or unauthorized damage, modification or disclosure. 
- Troubleshoot all system and user issues (hardware and software); report issues and status to manager, leader, or customer throughout the troubleshooting process.
